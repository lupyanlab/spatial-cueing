    1: >
      Today we want to measure your peripheral vision:
      how quickly can you find a faint shape that appears
      to either side of where you are looking? Press the
      SPACEBAR to continue the instructions.
    2: >
      In a moment, a small slightly transparent white square will
      appear inside the colorful shapes on the left. Press the SPACEBAR,
      and watch carefully for the target.
    3: >
      On each trial, one of these targets will appear in one of the
      four locations. Your job is to press the arrow key (up, down, left,
      or right) corresponding to where the target appeared.
    4: >
      Also on each trial, before the target appears you will be presented
      a cue. The cue could be an arrow, a written word, or a spoken word.
      Pay attention to these cues, as they may help you locate the target,
      but sometimes the cues will mislead you, so don't guess based on the
      cue alone.
    5: >
      Let's start with some practice trials. Please stare at the '+' in the
      center of the screen during the whole trial (i.e., try to see the target
      with your peripheral vision). Before you start, put on the
      headphones. Remember to press the arrow key corresponding to where
      you saw the target. When you are ready to start the practice trials,
      press the SPACEBAR.
  end_of_practice: >
    You've finished the practice trials. How did you do? Does the task
    make sense? If you have any questions, now is the time to ask the
    experimenter. When you are ready to begin the test trials, press
    the SPACEBAR.
  break_screen: >
    Take a moment to rest your eyes. Look away from the screen, squeeze
    your eyes a few times. When you are ready to continue press the SPACEBAR.
  end_of_experiment: >
    You're all done! We'd like you to complete a short survey. Press the
    SPACEBAR to exit the experiment, and a survey should open up in the
    web browser. If you don't see the survey, please let the experimenter
    know.
  timeout_screen: >
    You missed that one. Take a break if you need it. When you are
    ready to continue, press the SPACEBAR.
