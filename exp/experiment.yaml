    1: >
      Today we want to measure your peripheral vision:
      how quickly can you find a faint shape that appears
      to either side of where you are looking? Press the
      SPACEBAR to continue the instructions.
    2: >
      Do you see the small, slightly transparent white square inside
      the colorful shapes on the left? On each trial, one target will
      appear in either the left or the right square. It will quickly
      disappear. Your job is to press the 'f' key if you saw the target
      in the left square, and the 'j' key if you saw the target in the
      right square. To continue, press the SPACEBAR.
    3: >
      Let's start with some practice trials. Place both hands on the
      keyboard so you are ready to begin. Again, press the 'f' key
      if the target appears on the left side. Press the 'j' key if
      the target appears on the right side. When you are ready to start
      the practice trials, press the SPACEBAR.
  end_of_practice: >
    You've finished the practice trials. How did you do? Does the task
    make sense? If you have any questions, now is the time to ask the
    experimenter. When you are ready to begin the test trials, press
    the SPACEBAR.
  break_screen: >
    Take a moment to rest your eyes. When you are ready to continue
    press the SPACEBAR.
  end_of_experiment: >
    You're all done! You can exit the room when you are ready.
  timeout_screen: >
    You missed that one. Take a break if you need it. When you are
    ready to continue, press the SPACEBAR.
