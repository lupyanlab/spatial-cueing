    1: >
      Today we want to measure your peripheral vision:
      how quickly can you find a faint shape that appears
      to either side of where you are looking? Press the
      SPACEBAR to continue the instructions.
    2: >
      In a moment, a small slightly transparent white square will
      appear inside the colorful shapes on the left. Do you see it?
      On each trial, one of these targets will appear in either the left
      or the right locations. Your job is to press the 'f' key if the target
      appeared in the left square, and the 'j' key if you saw the target in
      the right square.
    3: >
      Let's start with some practice trials. First, please put on the
      headphones. Then, place both hands on the keyboard so you are  ready to
      begin. Again, press the 'f' key if the target appears  on the left side.
      Press the 'j' key if the target appears on  the right side. When you are
      ready to start the practice trials, press the SPACEBAR.
  end_of_practice: >
    You've finished the practice trials. How did you do? Does the task
    make sense? If you have any questions, now is the time to ask the
    experimenter. When you are ready to begin the test trials, press
    the SPACEBAR.
  break_screen: >
    Take a moment to rest your eyes. Look away from the screen, squeeze
    your eyes a few times. When you are ready to continue press the SPACEBAR.
  end_of_experiment: >
    You're all done! You can exit the room when you are ready.
  timeout_screen: >
    You missed that one. Take a break if you need it. When you are
    ready to continue, press the SPACEBAR.
