        body: >
            Today we want to measure your peripheral vision:
            how well can you see a faint shape that appears to either
            side of where you are looking? If you see the target
            shape (a white square. You'll see an example on the next
            page), we want you to press the SPACEBAR. If you don't
            see the target shape, you don't have to do anything.
            In case you're curious, this type of task is called
            a "go/no-go task".
        footer: Press the SPACEBAR to see an example of the target.
    target:

        title: Do you see the target inside the left square?
        body: >
            Below is a sample trial. Do you see the target, a white
            square? The targets will appear in either the left or the
            right flashing square. In the actual experiment, the
            target will appear and disappear very quickly. Because the
            target will appear very briefly, and because the target will
            appear equally likely on the left or right side, you will do
            the best if you try to observe both locations by starting in
            the middle of the screen, directly where the "+" sign appears.

        body: >
            As soon as you see the target, press the SPACEBAR.
            After the flashing squares, you will see a question mark
            like below. If you did not see a target, don't
            press anything during this part, and get ready for the next trial.
            We'll start with some practice trials. On each trial,
            try to observe both flashing squares by fixating in
            the center of the screen, right where the "+" appears.

            Please put the headphones on, and press the SPACEBAR to
            start the practice trials.

        body: >
            You got more than 3 wrong on the practice trials.
            Let's do them again to make sure you understand the task.
            Remember that you are looking for the white square as is
            present in the example below. During each trial, try to
            look at both flashing squares by fixating in the middle of
            the screen. That is, don't try to guess which flashing
            square will have the target before it appears.
        footer: >
            Press the SPACEBAR to try the practice trials again. Remember
            to press the SPACEBAR as soon as you see the target. If you don't
            see the target, don't press anything.

            If you have any questions, now is the time to ask
            the experimenter. For the next part, the targets
            might get harder to see, so you
            might be less certain that you are seeing
            a target. Please do your best, but know that you
            are expected to get some of them wrong.

    cue:

        title: We are going to add a cue before the target
        body: >
            Most of the trials will be
            exactly the same.  But on some of the trials you will see
            or hear a cue before the target appears.  For example, you
            might see an X in one of the boxes, or hear a word like
            "left".  Your task is exactly the same: stare at the
            fixation "+" during the entire trial and respond "yes"
            if you see the target in either square, and "no" if
            you do not.

            Press the SPACEBAR to continue. Please try to stare at the
            center of the screen during the trials.
