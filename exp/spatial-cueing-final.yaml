        title: Welcome to the SPC experiment
        body: >
            Today we want to measure your peripheral vision:
            how well can you see a faint shape presented to the
            left or the right of where you are looking? On some of the
            trials you will see a target, but there will be some trials
            where you don't see anything. We're interested in how
            quickly you can spot the targets when they are there, and
            how accurately you can tell if they're not. All you have to
            do is decide, for each trial, "Did I see a white square appear?"
        footer: Press the SPACEBAR to see an example target.
    target:

        title: Do you see the target inside the left square?
        body: >
            Below is a sample trial. Do you see the target, a white
            square? The targets will appear in either the left or the
            right flashing square.  In the actual experiment, the
            target will appear and disappear very quickly. For the
            experiment we ask that you stare in the middle of the two
            squares, directly where the "+" sign appears, during the trial.

        title: Ready for some practice trials?
        body: >
            We'll start with some practice trials. On each trial, 
            try to observe both flashing squares by fixating in
            the center of the screen, right where the "+" appears.
            If you see a target appear, press the "y" key on the
            keyboard. If you do not see a target, press the "u" key.
        footer: >
            Place two fingers of your dominant hand over the y and u
            keys. Then press the SPACEBAR to start the practice
            trials.

        body: >
            Your accuracy wasn't very high on those practice trials.
            Let's do the practice trials again. Remember that you are
            looking for the white square as is present in the example
            below. During each trial, try to stare in the middle of
            the two masks, that is, don't try to search both masks for
            the target.
        footer: >
            Press the SPACEBAR to try the practice trials again. Remember
            to press the "y" key if you see the target, and the "u" key
            if you didn't see the target.

            If you have any questions, now is the time to ask
            the experimenter. For the next part, the targets
            are going to get harder and harder to see, so you
            might be less and less certain that you are seeing
            a target. Please do your best, but know that you
            are expected to get some of them wrong.

    cue:

        title: We are going to add a cue before the target
        body: >
            Please put the headphones on. Most of the trials will be
            exactly the same.  But on some of the trials you will see
            or hear a cue before the target appears.  For example, you
            might see an X in one of the boxes, or hear a word like
            "left".  Your task is exactly the same: stare at the
            fixation "+" during the entire trial and respond "yes"
            if you see the target in either square, and "no" if
            you do not. The presence of a cue does not guarantee that
            a target will be present.

            You finished the experiment. The last thing for you to do
            is to answer a few questions about the experiment. The
            questions will appear in a web browser after you exit this
            screen. If you do not see any questions, let the
            experimenter know. When you have submitted your answers to
            the questions, you are free to go.
