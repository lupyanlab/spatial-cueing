            Today we will be measuring how easy it is for you to
            notice a target when it is flashed briefly on the screen.
            You will see a target on half of the trials. The other half
            of the time you won't see anything.

            Press the SPACEBAR to continue the instructions.
    target:
        visuals: [title, text, left, right, target]

        text: >
            Below is a sample trial. The target is presented in one of the squares.
            If you see a target in either square, press the 'y' key for "Yes, I saw
            a target." If you don't see a target, press the 'n' key for "No, I
            didn't see a target".

            Press the SPACEBAR to continue the instructions.

    You finished the experiment. The last thing for you to do is to
    answer a few questions about the experiment. The questions will
    appear in a web browser after you exit this screen. If you do not
    see any questions, let the experimenter know. When you have submitted
    your answers to the questions, you are free to go.

    Press the SPACEBAR to exit this screen, and see the questions.
