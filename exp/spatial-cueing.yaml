            Today we want to measure your peripheral vision:
            how quickly can you detect a faint shape that flashes
            to either side of where you are looking? 
            Press the SPACEBAR as soon as you see the target.
            You will see an example of the targets on the next
            page. If you don't see the target shape, don't press
            anything. In case you're curious, this type of experiment
            is called a "go/no-go task".
        footer: Press the SPACEBAR to see an example of the target.
    target:
        visuals: [title, body, footer, left, right, fix, target]
        triggers: [refresh, advance]
        title: Do you see the target?
        body: >
            Below you see an example of the target. Do you see the white
            square in the left flashing square? On each trial, one
            target will appear in either the left or the right flashing
            square. As soon as you see the target, press the SPACEBAR.
            It's harder than it sounds because in the experiment the
            target will appear very briefly, and you don't know which
            side it will be on. Because of how briefly the target
            will be visible, you will do the best if you try to observer
            both locations by staring in the middle of the screen,
            directly where the "+" appears.

        title: Ready for some practice?
        body: >
            You will start with 10 practice trials, just to get you
            comfortable with the task. You need to get 7 or more of
            the practice trials correct to move on. Remember that the
            target could appear in either location, so the best
            strategy is to simply look in the center of the screen.
            Press the SPACEBAR as soon as you see the target. If you
            do not see the target, don't press anything. If you get
            one wrong, you will hear a buzzer.

            Once your headphones are on, press the SPACEBAR to
            start the practice trials.

            You got more than 3 wrong on the practice trials.
            Let's do them again to make sure you understand the task.
            Ask the experimenter if you have any questions.
            Remember that you are looking for the white square as it
            is presented in the example below. Try to watch both
            flashing squares while fixating the middle of the screen.
        footer: >
            Press the SPACEBAR to try the practice trials again.
            Remember to press the SPACEBAR as soon as you see the
            target. If you don't see the target, don't press anything.

            Do you have any questions? For the next part of the
            experiment you will watch for the same target, but the
            target might get harder to see. While you are looking for
            the target, you might see one of the flashing squares
            highlighted in some way, or you might hear a word like
            "right" through the headphones. Sometimes these cues will
            help you, but sometimes they might mislead you.  No matter
            what you see or hear, your goal is exactly the same:
            carefully watch for the target to appear in either
            flashing square by fixating the center of the screen
            and pressing the SPACEBAR as soon as you see the
            target.

            This task is hard on your eyes. Take a break to refresh
            them. Look away from the screen, give them a rub,
            blink a few times.
