        title: Welcome to the SPC experiment
        body: >
            Today we want to measure your peripheral vision:
            how well can you see a faint target object presented to the
            left or the right of where you are looking? On most of the
            trials you will see a target, but there will be some trials
            where you don't see anything. We're interested in how
            quickly you can spot the targets when they are there, and
            how accurately you can tell if they're not. All you have to
            do is decide, for each trial, "Did I see the target?"
        footer: Press the SPACEBAR to see an example target.

        title: Do you see the target inside the left square?
        body: >
            Below is a sample trial. Do you see the target? The targets
            will appear in either the left or the right flashing square.
            In the actual experiment, the target will appear and disappear
            very quickly. Your best strategy is to stare in the middle of 
            the two squares, directly at the "+" sign.

        title: Ready for some practice trials?
        body: >
            We'll start with some practice trials. On each trial, 
            try to observe both flashing squares by fixating in
            the center of the screen, right where the "+" appears.
            If you see a target appear, press the "y" key on the
            keyboard. If you do not see a target, press the "u" key.
            y key: Yes, I saw a target.
            u key: No, I did not see a target.

            On each trial, you will see a word like "left" or "right",
            but your task is exactly the same.

            If you have any questions, now is the time to ask
            the experimenter. For the next part, the targets
            are going to get harder and harder to see, so you
            might be less and less certain that you are seeing
            a target. Please do your best, but know that you
            are expected to get some of them wrong.

            You finished the experiment. The last thing for you to do is to
            answer a few questions about the experiment. The questions will
            appear in a web browser after you exit this screen. If you do not
            see any questions, let the experimenter know. When you have submitted
            your answers to the questions, you are free to go.
